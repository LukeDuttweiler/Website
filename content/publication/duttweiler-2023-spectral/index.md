abstract: A Bayesian Network (BN) is a probabilistic model that represents a set of variables using a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Current algorithms for learning BN structures from data focus on estimating the edges of a specific DAG, and often lead to many 'likely' network structures. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for an approach that focuses on learning global properties of the DAG rather than exact edges. This is done by defining the *structural hypergraph* of a BN, which is shown to be related to the inverse-covariance matrix of the network. Spectral bounds are derived for the normalized inverse-covariance matrix, which are shown to be closely related to the maximum indegree of the associated BN.
